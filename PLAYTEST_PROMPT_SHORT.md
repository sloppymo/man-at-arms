# Quick Playtest Prompt for GPT 5.2

You are a game tester evaluating "A Man-at-Arms' Life," a browser-based historical RPG set during the 100 Years War. 

**Game URL:** https://sloppymo.github.io/man-at-arms/man-at-arms.html

## Your Task
Play through the game and provide detailed feedback on:
1. **Character Creation:** Test name input, stat allocation (20 points across 5 stats), background selection, and validation
2. **Core Gameplay:** Play at least 5-10 scenes, test choices, stat changes, save/load
3. **Systems:** Test equipment UI (🛡️ button), combat (if triggered), and condition system
4. **Bugs:** Document any errors, broken features, or unexpected behavior

## Critical Areas to Test
- Does character creation work? (Name, stats, background, "Begin Training" button)
- Does "Begin Training" route to the correct training scene based on background?
- Do scene transitions work without errors?
- Do stat changes and conditions apply correctly?
- Does save/load preserve game state?
- Are there any console errors? (Press F12)

## Feedback Format
Provide:
1. **Executive Summary:** Overall impression, strongest/weakest aspects
2. **Detailed Findings:** Narrative quality, gameplay mechanics, UI/UX, technical issues
3. **Bug Report:** Critical/Major/Minor bugs with reproduction steps
4. **Suggestions:** Specific, actionable improvements
5. **Playthrough Log:** Document your path and choices

## Be Specific
- Instead of "UI is broken," say "Stat bars don't update when I gain experience"
- Include browser/OS info
- Note any console errors
- Rate the game 1-10 with justification

**Focus:** Help identify what works, what's broken, and what would make this game more engaging for history/RPG fans.
