## CONTENT STYLE GUIDELINES

### Tone & Voice

**Primary Tone: Cormac McCarthy's "The Road" meets the Hundred Years' War**
- Stark, visceral, poetic realism
- Sparse, powerful prose with moments of lyrical beauty
- Focus on the physical, the visceral, the immediate
- Bleak but not without moments of humanity
- Biblical, almost mythic quality to the language
- Show the harsh realities: disease, hunger, violence, death
- Balance hope with despair, but lean toward the stark truth
- Show both nobility and brutality in raw, unvarnished terms
- Use period-appropriate language without being inaccessible

**Writing Style (Cormac McCarthy-Inspired):**

- **Sparse, powerful prose:** Short, punchy sentences mixed with longer, flowing, almost poetic passages. Let the rhythm and cadence carry meaning.
- **Minimal punctuation:** No quotation marks around dialogue. Use "he said" or "she said" sparingly. Let dialogue flow naturally into narrative.
- **Visceral physicality:** Focus on the body, the physical sensations, the weight of gear, the ache of muscles, the taste of blood and dust.
- **Sensory immersion:** Sight, sound, smell, touch, taste - especially the visceral ones. The stench of unwashed bodies, the metallic taste of fear, the weight of mail, the bite of cold.
- **Atmospheric density:** Build mood through description. The weather, the light, the shadows, the silence between sounds.
- **Stream of consciousness elements:** Internal thoughts can flow without attribution, blending into narrative.
- **Biblical/poetic language:** Use language that feels almost mythic, elevated, but grounded in the physical world.
- **Show, don't tell:** Let players experience through visceral description. Show the world through the body, through sensation.
- **Period language:** Use medieval terms naturally (serf, villein, chevauchée, routier, etc.) but let them flow naturally.
- **Length is flexible:** Content CAN be long and detailed, but doesn't HAVE to be. Some scenes may be brief and punchy, others may be extended. Let the content determine the length, not a strict requirement.

### Style Reference: Cormac McCarthy's "The Road"

**McCarthy's Style Characteristics:**
- **Sparse punctuation:** No quotation marks, minimal commas, periods do the work
- **Short and long sentences:** Mix of punchy fragments and flowing, almost biblical prose
- **Physical immediacy:** Everything is felt through the body, through sensation
- **Atmospheric density:** Mood built through description of weather, light, sound, silence
- **Visceral detail:** Focus on what things feel like, smell like, taste like
- **Poetic language:** Elevated, almost mythic quality, but grounded in the physical
- **Stream of consciousness:** Thoughts flow into narrative without clear boundaries
- **Dialogue without attribution:** Let speech stand on its own, minimal "he said/she said"

**Length Flexibility:**
- Content CAN be long and detailed (4-8 paragraphs) when the scene calls for it
- Content CAN be short and punchy (1-2 paragraphs) when brevity serves the moment
- Let the content and mood determine length, not a strict requirement
- Some scenes benefit from extended description, others from stark brevity
- The key is the QUALITY of the prose, not the QUANTITY

### Flavor Event Format (McCarthy-Style Narrative)

```javascript

    title: "Event Title",
    year: function() { return gameState.year; },
    age: function() { return gameState.age; },
    location: function() { return gameState.location; },

        // - Sparse, powerful prose with rhythm and cadence

        // - Atmospheric description (weather, light, sound, silence)
        // - Minimal punctuation, no quotation marks around dialogue
        // - Mix of short sentences and longer, flowing passages
        // - Biblical/poetic quality to language
        // - Stream of consciousness elements
        // - Focus on the physical, the immediate, the visceral
        return `<p>Short, punchy sentences. Then longer flowing passages. The rhythm carries meaning. The physical world presses in. Weather. Light. Sound. Silence.</p>
               <p>Dialogue flows without quotation marks. He said this. She said that. The words stand on their own. The body remembers what the mind tries to forget.</p>
               <p>Extended description when needed. The weight of mail. The ache of muscles. The taste of blood and dust. The stench of unwashed bodies and fear.</p>
               <p>Or brief and stark when that serves better. Sometimes less is more. Sometimes the silence between words says everything.</p>`;
    },
    choices: [
        {
            text: "Action description",
            effects: { /* stat changes */ },

## CONTENT REQUIREMENTS

### Length and Detail Requirements

**FLEXIBLE: Content length should serve the scene, not a strict requirement.**

1. **Length Flexibility:**
   - Content CAN be long and detailed (4-8 paragraphs) when the scene calls for it
   - Content CAN be short and punchy (1-2 paragraphs) when brevity serves the moment
   - Some scenes benefit from extended description, others from stark brevity
   - The key is the QUALITY and STYLE of the prose, not the QUANTITY
   - Let the mood and content determine length

2. **Detail Density (When Extended):**
   - Every paragraph should contain visceral sensory details
   - Layer descriptions: environment → characters → actions → thoughts → consequences
   - Don't rush through scenes—let them breathe when they need to
   - Include dialogue, internal monologue, and detailed observations when appropriate

3. **Narrative Pacing:**
   - Build atmosphere through description (extended or brief, as needed)
   - Show character reactions and thoughts through the body, through sensation
   - Let the rhythm of the prose carry meaning
   - Some moments need space to breathe, others need to hit hard and fast

### Historical Accuracy

1. **Period-Appropriate Details:**
   - Technology: No anachronisms (no full plate armor in 1337, no gunpowder cannons everywhere)
   - Social structure: Feudal hierarchy, class distinctions
   - Language: Period-appropriate terms, but readable
   - Geography: Accurate French regions, cities, terrain
   - Events: Align with historical timeline

2. **Cultural Authenticity:**
   - French vs. English perspectives
   - Regional differences (Normandy vs. Gascony vs. Île-de-France)
   - Religious practices and beliefs
   - Social customs and norms
   - Economic realities

3. **Military Realism:**
   - Accurate tactics and equipment for the period
   - Realistic campaign logistics
   - Actual historical battles and sieges
   - Period-appropriate weapons and armor

### Gritty Realism

1. **Show the Harsh Reality:**
   - Disease and death are common
   - Hunger and famine
   - Violence and brutality
   - Poverty and desperation
   - Weather and hardship
   - Loss and grief

2. **Avoid Romanticization:**
   - No "noble savage" tropes
   - No sanitized violence
   - No idealized medieval life
   - Show both good and evil in all classes

3. **Balance Hope and Despair:**
   - Moments of beauty and humanity
   - Acts of kindness and courage
   - But don't sugarcoat the era

### Immersive Descriptions (McCarthy-Style)

1. **Sensory Details (Visceral and Physical):**
   - **Sight:** Visual details that matter. The way light falls. The color of things. What the eyes see and what they don't.
   - **Sound:** Clashing steel. Shouting. Animals. Nature. Voices. Music. Most importantly: silence. The space between sounds.
   - **Smell:** The stench of unwashed bodies. Waste. Smoke. Cooking. Decay. Flowers. Earth. The smell of fear.
   - **Touch:** The weight of mail. The chafe of fabric. The texture of mud. The bite of cold. The ache of muscles. The feel of steel.
   - **Taste:** Food. Drink. Blood. Dust. The metallic taste of fear. The bitterness of defeat.

2. **Environmental Details (Atmospheric):**
   - Weather and seasons. How they press on the body. How they shape the mood.
   - Terrain and landscape. How it looks. How it feels underfoot. How it shapes movement.
   - Time of day. Morning light. Afternoon heat. Evening chill. Night darkness. The quality of light.
   - Urban vs. rural. The difference in the air. The difference in the sounds. The difference in the people.
   - Ruins and destruction. What was. What is. What remains. The weight of absence.
   - Natural beauty. Moments of peace. Moments of beauty. Amidst the war.

3. **Cultural Details (Through the Physical):**
   - Architecture and buildings. Materials. Construction. Condition. What they say about the people who built them.
   - Clothing and appearance. Fabrics. Condition. What they reveal. What they hide.
   - Food and drink. What's available. How it's prepared. How it tastes. How it feels in the mouth.
   - Customs and rituals. How they're performed. What they mean. What they cost.
   - Language and dialects. How people speak. What the words reveal. What the silences say.

### Meaningful Choices

1. **Clear Consequences:**
   - Each choice should have visible effects
   - Stat changes, reputation, relationships
   - Short-term and long-term consequences
   - Some choices should be morally ambiguous

2. **Multiple Valid Options:**
   - No single "correct" choice
   - Different paths for different playstyles
   - Trade-offs (gain one thing, lose another)

3. **Branching Narrative:**
   - Choices should lead to different scenes
   - Earlier choices affect later options
   - Character build affects available choices

## CONTENT EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Campaign Flavor Event (McCarthy Style)

```javascript
march_through_normandy: {
    title: "The Road to Caen",
    year: 1346,
    age: function() { return gameState.age; },
    location: "Normandy",
    text: function() {
        const name = gameState.characterName || "Soldier";
        return `<p>The sun beat down. The column moved through empty fields. The peasants had fled. What remained: a broken cart wheel. A child's toy in the mud. Blackened hayricks. Smoke rose ahead. The smell of burning thatch. Something fouler on the wind.</p>
               
               <p>Your boots were caked with mud. Each step a labor. The clay clung to your soles. The mail chafed where the padding had worn thin. You felt the weight of it all. Sword. Shield. The few things you'd kept. Wat walked beside you. A veteran from Yorkshire. He spat into the dust. French wine and English steel, he muttered. His face was weathered. Scars. Lines of hard living. His eyes never stopped moving.</p>
               
               <p>The column stretched ahead and behind. A snake of men and horses winding through the Norman landscape. The creak of leather. The jingle of harness. Low voices trying to pass the time. Someone sang a bawdy song. Others joined in. Rough. Off-key. It broke the monotony. Ahead the vanguard had stopped. The word passed back. Something blocks the road.</p>
               
               <p>You craned your neck. The press of men. The dust. Your view was obscured. Hold, the sergeant called. Hold in place. The column ground to a halt. In the sudden quiet you heard voices. French voices. Too fast to understand. But the tone was clear. Fear. Anger. Desperation.</p>
               
               <p>Wat shifted. His hand moved to his sword. Trouble, he said. It wasn't a question. Around you men checked weapons. Adjusted shields. The easy camaraderie was gone. Replaced by the tension that comes before violence. Your heart beat faster. The familiar mix. Fear and anticipation.</p>
               
               <p>The captain rode past. His horse's hooves kicked up dust. Stay alert, he called. We don't know what's ahead. But we'll find out. He didn't slow. Heading toward the vanguard. You looked at Wat. He gave you a grim smile. Well ${name}, he said. Looks like we might earn our pay today after all.</p>`;

        return `<p>The evening settled. The chill came with it. Around a small fire men huddled over a game of hazard. Their faces lit by the flames. The dice clattered. A wooden board. Crude markings. Coins changed hands. Metal on metal. The air was thick with pipe smoke. Sweet. Earthy. The acrid scent of burning wood. The smell of ale. Fresh and spilled.</p>
               
               <p>Veterans with scars. Younger men learning the trade. All drawn together. The need to pass time. To forget. If only for a moment. What tomorrow might bring. Their voices were low. Curses. Laughs. Eyes fixed on the dice. Tumbling across the board. The game was simple. Roll. Bet. Win or lose. But the stakes felt higher. As if each roll carried the weight of fate.</p>
               
               <p>Thomas looked up. A bowman from Kent. Ready smile. Quick hands. He grinned. His face was flushed. From the fire. From the ale. From the excitement. His eyes had that bright focused look. The look that comes with gambling. ${name}, he called. Come join us. The French haven't killed us yet. But this game might finish the job.</p>
               
               <p>The other men looked up. Their expressions ranged from welcoming to calculating. A big man. Broken nose. Thick beard. He grunted. Shifted to make room. Aye come sit, he said. We could use fresh blood. There was something in his tone. He meant it. Fresh money. Fresh luck. Fresh opportunity to take what you have.</p>
               
               <p>You checked your purse. Felt the weight of the coins. ${wealth} shillings. Hard-won. From plunder. From pay. The thought of risking it made your stomach tighten. But the men were betting heavily. The pot grew with each roll. Silver coins gleaming in the firelight. A small fortune. If you were lucky enough to win it.</p>
               
               <p>The dice clattered again. Someone groaned. Another laughed. Coins were pushed across the board. The game continued. Thomas watched you. His expression expectant. The question in his eyes. Will you join. Or will you walk away. The fire crackled. Sparks into the night sky. In the distance the sounds of camp. Horses. Men talking. The noise of an army at rest. But here around this small fire the world had narrowed. To the roll of dice. To the turn of fortune.</p>`;

Gaping mouths. Revealing the darkness within. No smoke rose from the hearths. No children played in the streets. No animals lowed in the fields. The silence was profound. Broken only by the wind. Whistling through empty doorways. The harsh cawing of crows.</p>
               
               <p>Signs of hasty departure everywhere. A cooking pot by a doorway. Its contents long since spoiled. A child's wooden toy. Half-buried in the mud. What was once a street. A door torn from its hinges. Wood splintered. Broken. The gardens were overgrown. Weeds. The fields beyond showed the stubble of a harvest never completed. The whole place had the look of something that was alive not long ago. Abandoned to decay.</p>
               
               <p>In the center a well stood. Its stone rim weathered. Cracked. The bucket still attached to its rope. Hanging motionless in the darkness below. A few chickens pecked at the dirt. The only living things. They scattered as you approached. Their clucking the only sound of life in this dead place. The smell of decay was faint but present. Something died here. Recently enough that the scent hadn't fully dissipated. The smell of rot. Of things left to spoil. It made your stomach turn.</p>
               
               <p>Your commander rode up. His horse's hooves loud in the silence. He surveyed the village. A practiced eye. His expression grim. Empty, he said. It wasn't a question. They knew we were coming. He dismounted. His boots sank into the mud. Quick search, he called to the men. Take what's useful. Food. Tools. Anything that might serve. But be quick. We're not staying the night in this place.</p>
               
               <p>The men spread out. Moving cautiously. Some went to the houses. Weapons drawn. Others checked the outbuildings. The fields beyond. You heard them calling to each other. Their voices echoing in the empty spaces. The sound of doors being forced open. Things being moved. Examined. But there was a tension in the air. A sense that this place was wrong. That something bad happened here. Everyone felt it.</p>
               
               <p>You stood at the edge of the village. Looking at the empty houses. The overgrown fields. You wondered what happened to the people who once lived here. Did they flee. Were they taken. Did they die. The questions hung in the air. Like the smell of decay. Unanswered. Unsettling. This is what war does. It empties places. Leaves them hollow and dead. Moves on to the next village. The next town. The next life to disrupt or destroy.</p>`;

### Example 4: Social Interaction Event (McCarthy Style)

```javascript

        const charisma = gameState.stats.charisma || 5;
        return `<p>The old man approached slowly. His steps hesitant. As if each one might be his last. He was thin. Gaunt almost. His clothes hung loose. A frame that spoke of hunger. Of hard work. His tunic was patched. Multiple places. The fabric worn thin. His boots were scraps of leather. Bound with twine. His hands were raised. Supplication. The universal gesture of someone who has nothing left but hope. His face was lined. The marks of age. Of worry.</p>
               
               <p>He spoke in the Norman dialect. His words tumbling out. Too fast to understand. The accent was thick. The vowels rounded. Different from the English you were used to. His voice was cracked with emotion. He gestured as he spoke. Pointing back the way he came. Toward the fields. The village beyond. His movements were desperate. Pleading.</p>
               
               <p>Geoffrey stepped forward. A man who'd served in Gascony. Learned enough of the local tongue. He listened. His brow furrowed. Then he began to translate. Haltingly. He says the French soldiers came three days ago. Took his son. Press-ganged him. Dragged him away. The boy didn't want to go. But what choice did he have.</p>
               
               <p>The old man continued speaking. His voice rising. Geoffrey listened. Nodded. Translated again. His daughter is sick. Fever. Can't get out of bed. His wife died last winter. Now he has no one to tend the fields. The harvest is coming. If he can't bring it in they'll starve. He begs for help. Any help.</p>
               
               <p>The old man's eyes were desperate. You could see the fear in them. Not just fear of you. English soldiers in his land. But fear of what will happen. If he can't get help. If he can't bring in the harvest. If his daughter doesn't recover. He knows what English soldiers are capable of. What any soldiers are capable of in this war. He's seen the devastation. The burned fields. The empty villages. The bodies by the roadside. But he's come anyway. Because he has no other choice.</p>
               
               <p>Around you the camp continued. Men tending fires. Checking equipment. Talking. Laughing. But here in this small space there was a moment of stillness. A pause. The old man stood before you. His hands still raised. His eyes fixed on your face. Waiting. Behind him the Norman countryside stretched away. Green and peaceful in the afternoon light. But you knew that peace was an illusion. War had come to this place. It had left its mark on everyone it touched.</p>`;

## WRITING GUIDELINES

### Do's

✅ **DO:**
- **Write in McCarthy's style:** Sparse, powerful prose with rhythm and cadence
- **Use visceral physical details:** Focus on what things feel like, smell like, taste like
- **Mix sentence lengths:** Short, punchy sentences mixed with longer, flowing passages
- **Minimal punctuation:** No quotation marks around dialogue. Let dialogue flow naturally
- **Atmospheric density:** Build mood through description of weather, light, sound, silence
- **Biblical/poetic language:** Elevated, almost mythic quality, but grounded in the physical
- **Stream of consciousness:** Let thoughts flow into narrative without clear boundaries
- Show the harsh reality of medieval life through visceral, physical description
- Include period-appropriate language naturally
- Create morally ambiguous choices
- Balance hope and despair (but lean toward stark truth)
- Reference real historical events and places
- Use French regional differences
- Include diverse perspectives (nobles, peasants, clergy, merchants)
- Make choices have clear consequences
- **Length is flexible:** Write as long or as short as the scene demands
- Focus on the physical, the immediate, the visceral

### Don'ts

❌ **DON'T:**
- Romanticize the medieval period
- Use modern language or concepts
- Include anachronisms
- Make choices too obvious (good vs. evil)
- Sugarcoat violence or hardship
- Ignore historical context
- Use clichéd medieval tropes
- Forget the French perspective
- Make all events negative (balance is key, but lean toward stark truth)
- **Overuse quotation marks** - dialogue should flow without them
- **Over-explain** - let the prose and rhythm carry meaning
- **Forget the physical** - everything should be felt through the body
- **Ignore atmosphere** - weather, light, sound, silence all matter

## FINAL NOTES

Remember:
- **STYLE IS CRITICAL:** Write in Cormac McCarthy's style - sparse, powerful, visceral, poetic. This is the primary requirement.
- **LENGTH IS FLEXIBLE:** Content CAN be long (4-8 paragraphs) when the scene calls for it, or short (1-2 paragraphs) when brevity serves. Let the content determine length.
- **Quality over quantity:** Better to have 50 excellent, stylistically consistent events than 100 generic ones
- **Historical accuracy matters:** Research when needed
- **Player immersion is key:** Make them feel they're in 14th century France through visceral, physical, atmospheric description
- **Choices should matter:** Every decision should have consequences
- **Balance is important:** Mix light and dark, hope and despair (but lean toward stark truth)
- **French perspective:** Remember the player is in France, encountering French people and culture
- **Focus on the physical:** Everything should be felt through the body, through sensation, through the visceral reality of medieval life

**Create content that makes players feel the weight of history, the grit of medieval life, and the complexity of the Hundred Years' War. Make them experience 14th century France through prose that echoes Cormac McCarthy's "The Road" - sparse, powerful, visceral, poetic, and unflinchingly real.**

---

**Begin generating content. Start with Campaign Events and Camp Life Events, as these will be most commonly encountered. Create 20-30 events in each category, then move on to other categories.**

**REMEMBER: Write in McCarthy's style. Length is flexible - let the scene determine whether it needs to be short and punchy or long and detailed. The key is the QUALITY and STYLE of the prose, not strict length requirements.**
