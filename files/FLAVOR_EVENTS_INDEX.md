## WRITING STYLE CHARACTERISTICS

### McCarthy's Prose Elements (Present in All Events):

1. **Sparse Punctuation**
   - Minimal commas
   - No quotation marks around dialogue
   - Periods doing most of the work
   - Short declarative sentences mixed with longer flowing passages

2. **Physical & Visceral Details**
   - What things feel like (weight of mail, chafe of fabric)
   - What things smell like (smoke, blood, sweat, rot)
   - What things taste like (dust, fear, metal)
   - Body sensations (aching, numbness, exhaustion)

3. **Atmospheric Density**
   - Weather (rain, cold, heat, wind)
   - Light quality (dawn, dusk, firelight, darkness)
   - Sound (silence, birdsong, clashing steel, voices)
   - Environmental description building mood

4. **Stream of Consciousness**
   - Thoughts flowing into narrative
   - Internal monologue without clear attribution
   - Memory and present blending
   - Philosophical reflection

5. **Biblical/Poetic Language**
   - Elevated but grounded language
   - Almost mythic quality
   - Rhythmic, cadenced prose
   - Symbolic imagery

6. **Dialogue Integration**
   - No quotation marks
   - "He said" used sparingly
   - Dialogue flowing naturally into narrative
   - Speech revealing character

### Length Flexibility

- **Short & Punchy** (1-2 paragraphs): Some events for immediate impact
- **Medium** (3-4 paragraphs): Standard event length
- **Long & Detailed** (5-8 paragraphs): Extended scenes for immersion
- **Key Principle**: Length serves the scene, not a formula

## INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Locate the Scenes Object

In `man-at-arms.html`, find the `scenes` object (around line 1500-6000). This is where all game scenes are defined.

### Step 2: Add Events to Scenes Object

Copy events from the JavaScript files and paste them into the `scenes` object. Each event should be added as a new property:

```javascript
const scenes = {
    // Existing scenes...
    
    // NEW FLAVOR EVENTS - Add here
    march_through_normandy_1: {
        title: "The Road to Caen",
        year: 1346,
        age: function() { return gameState.age; },
        location: "Normandy",
        text: function() {
            // ... event text
        },
        choices: [
            // ... choices
        ]
    },
    
    // More events...
};
```

### Step 3: Link Events to Game Flow

Events can be triggered in several ways:

1. **From Other Scenes**: Set `nextScene` to the flavor event name
2. **Random Encounters**: Add to encounter pools
3. **Year-Specific**: Use conditional logic based on `gameState.year`
4. **Location-Specific**: Trigger based on `gameState.location`

Example of linking:
```javascript
march_continues: {
    // ... existing scene
    choices: [
        {
            text: "Continue the march",
            nextScene: function() {
                // Random chance to trigger flavor event
                if (Math.random() < 0.3) {
                    return "march_through_normandy_1";
                }
                return "next_standard_scene";
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 4: Add Outcome Scenes

Many flavor events reference outcome scenes (e.g., `dice_game_win`, `prisoner_freed`). You'll need to create these continuation scenes:

```javascript
dice_game_win: {
    title: "Fortune Smiles",
    year: function() { return gameState.year; },
    age: function() { return gameState.age; },
    location: function() { return gameState.location; },
    text: function() {
        return `<p>You won. The dice came up in your favor...</p>`;
    },
    choices: [
        {
            text: "Continue",
            effects: { morale: 1 },
            nextScene: "camp_rest"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 5: Test Integration

1. Start game and navigate to a flavor event
2. Verify text displays correctly
3. Test all choice branches
4. Check stat changes apply properly
5. Ensure nextScene transitions work

## CUSTOMIZATION TIPS

### Adjusting Difficulty

Resolution checks use this format:
```javascript
requiresResolution: true,
resolutionStat: "agility",
resolutionDifficulty: 7  // <-- Adjust this (5-10 range)
```

- **Easy**: 5-6
- **Medium**: 7-8  
- **Hard**: 9-10

### Modifying Effects

Stat changes can be adjusted:
```javascript
effects: { 
    strength: 1,      // Increase stat
    reputation: -2,   // Decrease stat
    stress: 1         // Add stress
}
```

### Adding Artwork

Include artwork references:
```javascript
artwork: "artwork/battle-scene.jpg",
artworkCaption: "The fields of Crécy, 1346"
```

### Dynamic Text

Use gameState variables for personalization:
```javascript
text: function() {
    const name = gameState.characterName || "Soldier";
    const age = gameState.age || 25;
    const year = gameState.year || 1337;
    
    return `<p>${name}, at ${age} years old, marched through France in ${year}...</p>`;
}
```

## CONCLUSION

This collection provides 65+ historically accurate, narratively rich flavor events that immerse players in the Hundred Years' War through McCarthy-esque prose. Events are ready for integration and can be expanded infinitely using the same style guidelines and structure.

**The goal**: Make players feel the weight of history, the grit of medieval life, and the complexity of war through sparse, powerful, visceral storytelling that echoes "The Road" but grounds itself firmly in 14th century France.

**Patron Integration**: The patron-specific events (Part 6) dynamically reflect the player's chosen patron, creating personalized narrative experiences that change based on whether they serve under Sir James "The Reaver" de Looney, Sir David de Montfort, Baron Caley of Harwich, Count Charles "The Fair" of Suffolk, or Ashkhan of Tripoli. Each patron's leadership style, values, and methods are reflected in these events.

**Remember**: Quality over quantity. Better 50 excellent events than 100 generic ones. Each event should feel authentic, meaningful, and true to both the historical period and McCarthy's distinctive literary style.
