               <p>Birds had gone quiet. That was the first sign. The forest should be full of sound. Birdsong. Animals moving through brush. But there was nothing. Just silence. The kind of silence that meant predators. Men were predators. The worst kind. They could be anywhere. Behind any tree. In any shadow.</p>

Deciding. Whether to attack. Whether to let you pass. Whether today was the day they'd try their luck against armed men.</p>
               <p>Something glinted in the trees. Sunlight on metal. There and gone. But you'd seen it. Others too. The sergeant called a halt. His voice low. Everyone quiet. Listen, he said. You listened. For a long moment nothing. Then you heard it. The creak of a bow being drawn. The whisper of men moving through undergrowth. Not one. Many. You were surrounded. Or about to be.</p>
               <p>The captain made his decision fast. He'd been a soldier long enough to know. Fighting in the forest favored the ambushers. Better to show strength. Move fast. Give no opening. Column forward, he called. Double pace. Archers to the flanks. Anyone attacks we don't stop. We go through them. The column surged forward. Moving fast. Daring the watchers to try something. They didn't. Cowards or smart. Didn't matter. You made it through.</p>`;

No children played in the streets. No animals in the fields. The silence was profound. Broken only by wind. The harsh calling of crows.</p>
               <p>Signs of hasty departure everywhere. A cooking pot by a doorway. Its contents long spoiled. A child's wooden toy. Half-buried in mud. What was once a street. A door torn from hinges. Wood splintered. Broken. The gardens overgrown. Weeds choking what crops remained. The fields beyond showed stubble. A harvest never completed. Life interrupted. Abandoned to decay.</p>

The only living things. They scattered as you approached. Their clucking the only sound of life in this dead place. The smell of decay was faint. Present. Something died here. Recently enough that the scent remained. Rot. Things left to spoil.</p>

Doors forced. Things moved. Examined. But there was tension. A sense that this place was wrong. That something bad happened here. Everyone felt it. This is what war does. Empties places. Leaves them hollow. Moves on to the next village. The next town. The next life to disrupt or destroy.</p>`;

Just the cold and whether his body could fight it.</p>

Pitiless. Caring nothing for your struggle. This was winter in France. This was war in the cold months. This was what it meant to serve. Not glory. Not honor. This. The frost. The numbness. The endless walking toward some destination that might not even matter.</p>`;

To the roll of dice. To the turn of fortune.</p>`;

Kept preparing for the next time you'd need to use this blade to take a life.</p>`;

The universal gesture of someone who has nothing left but hope. Face was lined. Marks of age. Of worry.</p>

Voice was cracked with emotion. He gestured as he spoke. Pointing back the way he came. Toward fields. Village beyond. Movements were desperate. Pleading.</p>

               <p>The old man continued speaking. Voice rising. Geoffrey listened. Nodded. Translated again. His daughter is sick. Fever. Can't get out of bed. Wife died last winter. Now he has no one to tend the fields. Harvest is coming. If he can't bring it in they'll starve. He begs for help. Any help.</p>

If he can't bring in harvest. If his daughter doesn't recover. He knows what English soldiers are capable of. What any soldiers are capable of in this war. He's seen the devastation. Burned fields. Empty villages. Bodies by the roadside. But he's come anyway. Because he has no other choice.</p>

But you knew that peace was an illusion. War had come to this place. Left its mark on everyone it touched.</p>`;

The devotions of travelers. Of locals. Of people seeking protection. Seeking mercy. Seeking something from God or the saints or whatever power might listen.</p>
               <p>The cross was old. Pre-Christian some said. A place of power long before Christ. The Church had claimed it. Put their symbol here. But the old power remained. You could feel it. In the way the air moved. In the silence that surrounded this place. As if the world held its breath here. Waiting. Watching.</p>
               <p>Someone had carved words into the base. Latin. You couldn't read them but you knew what they said. Prayers. Pleas. The desperate words of people at the end of hope. This was a place of last resort. Where you came when there was nowhere else to turn. When human aid had failed. When only divine intervention might help.</p>
               <p>The column had stopped for water. The crossroads had a well. Men were filling skins. Watering horses. Taking a moment's rest. But no one disturbed the shrine. No one took the offerings. Even the most cynical soldiers left such places alone. Maybe from respect. Maybe from fear. Some things you didn't touch. Some places you didn't defile. Not if you wanted to keep your soul.</p>
               <p>You stood before the cross. Thinking about what you'd done. What you'd become. The lives taken. The destruction wrought. The sins accumulated. This shrine offered forgiveness. Offered peace. All you had to do was ask. Make an offering. Say the words. But could forgiveness be that simple. Could absolution erase what you'd done. You didn't know. But the cross stood there. Waiting. If you wanted it.</p>`;

               <p>I was at Bannockburn, he said. His voice was soft. Almost dreamy. As if remembering took him somewhere else. Somewhere far from this French field. We thought we'd win easy. English knights against Scottish rabble. But the Scots had pikes. And they had ground. And they had Bruce.</p>

Just broke and ran. I was young then. Fast. I made it out. Many didn't. I can still hear them. Screaming. Dying. Under those Scottish pikes.</p>
               <p>The other men listened. Silent. Everyone had stories. Everyone had battles they'd survived. Or barely survived. But hearing them told. Hearing the pain in an old soldier's voice. That made it real. Made it human. Reminded you that beneath the armor. Beneath the weapons. You were all just men. Frightened men. Trying to survive.</p>

The faces of the men we killed. The friends we lost. They stay with you. Forever. That's the real price of being a soldier. Not the wounds. Not the scars. The memories. Those hurt worst of all.</p>`;

An efficient one. You'd lost count of how many men you'd killed. Stopped trying to remember their faces. But they were there. In the dark. In the quiet. Waiting.</p>
               <p>The question was whether any of the old you remained. Whether the person you were before the war still existed. Somewhere inside. Buried beneath the scars and the memories and the things you'd done. Or if war had killed that person. Replaced him completely. Left nothing but this. This hollow shell. This weapon. This thing that killed and survived and kept killing.</p>
               <p>The sun touched the horizon. The light fading. Darkness coming. Always coming. You didn't have answers. Maybe there were no answers. Maybe you'd been asking the wrong questions. Maybe it didn't matter who you were before. Only who you were now. Only what you did next. The past was dead. Like so many other things. All you had was now. This moment. This choice. What to do with it.</p>`;

The next day.</p>

Even to places where men killed each other for reasons most of them couldn't explain.</p>`;

Destroyed their lives. Why should these people trust you.</p>

The baby cried. And the refugee column flowed past. Rivers of suffering. Displacement. The cost of war paid by those who never chose it.</p>`;
