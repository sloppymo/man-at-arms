## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Historical Figures** ⭐⭐⭐
**Issue**: Limited mention of actual historical figures
- **Present**: References to "King Edward III" and "Black Prince" (Edward of Woodstock)
- **Missing**: 
  - Philip VI of France
  - John II of France (captured at Poitiers)
  - Specific commanders and nobles
  - Real historical personalities

**Recommendation**: Add more named historical figures as NPCs or in events. Players should encounter real commanders, see real nobles, hear about actual political events.

### 2. **Cultural Authenticity** ⭐⭐⭐
**Issue**: Some anachronisms and modern sensibilities
- **Irreverent Dialogue**: While fun, phrases like "I don't give a shit" and "fucking idiot" are very modern
- **Character Attitudes**: Some characters (especially Wat) have very modern cynical perspectives
- **Social Commentary**: Some observations feel more 21st-century than 14th-century

**Recommendation**: 
- Keep irreverent options but make them period-appropriate (e.g., "By God's bones!" instead of "fuck off")
- Ensure character worldviews reflect medieval mentalities, not modern ones

### 3. **Economic Realism** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Issue**: Wealth values need verification
- **Starting Wealth**: 120 pence (10 shillings) - needs verification against historical records
- **Prices**: Various costs (medical care, bribes, equipment) need historical validation
- **Plunder Values**: Pillaging rewards should reflect actual medieval plunder patterns

**Recommendation**: Research actual 14th-century wages, prices, and plunder values. A man-at-arms' daily wage, cost of equipment, medical care, etc.

### 4. **Military Tactics & Equipment** ⭐⭐⭐
**Issue**: Limited detail on actual combat mechanics
- **Weapons**: Mentions swords, knives, longbows, but limited detail
- **Armor**: Little mention of actual armor types (mail, plate, etc.)
- **Tactics**: Battle descriptions are good but could be more detailed
- **Formations**: Limited discussion of actual medieval formations

**Recommendation**: Add more detail about:
- Specific weapon types (arming sword, longsword, poleaxe, etc.)
- Armor progression (mail → coat of plates → plate)
- Tactical formations (schiltron, shield wall, etc.)

### 5. **Daily Life Authenticity** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Strengths**:
- Campfire scenes show camp life
- References to food, weather, disease
- Shows the grind of medieval warfare

**Missing**:
- More detail on camp organization
- Religious practices (very important in 14th century)
- Medical practices (beyond basic mentions)
- Relationships with local populations

**Recommendation**: Add scenes about:
- Mass and religious observance
- Medieval medicine and surgery
- Interactions with French civilians
- Camp organization and logistics

### 6. **Political Context** ⭐⭐⭐
**Issue**: Limited political/historical context
- **Present**: Basic war context (England vs. France)
- **Missing**:
  - Causes of the war (succession dispute, Gascony, etc.)
  - Political motivations
  - Relationship to other conflicts (Scottish wars, etc.)
  - Feudal obligations and service

**Recommendation**: Add educational moments that explain:
- Why the war started
- Feudal obligations
- Political motivations of leaders
- Relationship to other contemporary conflicts
